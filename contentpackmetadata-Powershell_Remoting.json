Updates to the pack during the beta phase might include non-backward compatible features. We appreciate your feedback on the quality and usability of the pack to help us identify issues, fix them, and continually improve.\n\nPowershell Remoting is a built-in feature in Windows that enables connecting remotely to hosts in order to execute scripts and Powershell commands. By using Powershell Remoting, the SOC analyst or incident responder is able to connect to a Windows host and perform tasks such as gathering data, remediating the host, moving files to and from the host and XSOAR, and much more.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nAllows you to interact with Windows hosts for actions such as acquiring forensic data.\n\nThe pack includes the Powershell Remoting integration.\n\n##### Need to know\nThis pack is recommended to use in conjunction with the [Windows Forensics Pack](https://xsoar.pan.dev/marketplace/details/WindowsForensics) which contains playbooks and other content to use with this integration.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/articles/Powershell_Remoting_-_Configuration).\n",
