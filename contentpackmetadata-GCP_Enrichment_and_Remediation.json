The intent was that users can install and use only the packs they need.  However, if a GCP playbook uses multiple pack integrations (such\nas GSuiteAdmin and GCP-IAM), they can't reside in one of the current packs because they include content from multiple packs.  This \npack was created as a place to put GCP playbooks that use GCP integrations from multiple packs with a focus on enrichment and \nremediation.\n\n### Playbooks\n\nUsers are only able to run the playbook in v6.5.0 or higher as it requires commands to execute the task.\nThis content pack includes the following playbooks: \n\n- Cloud Response - GCP\n![Cloud Response - GCP](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-dist/content/packs/GCP-Enrichment-Remediation/readme_images/Cloud_Response_-_GCP.png)\n\n- GCP - Enrichment  \n![GCP - Enrichment](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-dist/content/packs/GCP-Enrichment-Remediation/readme_images/GCP_-_Enrichment.png)\n\n- GCP - Firewall Remediation\n![GCP - Firewall Remediation](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-dist/content/packs/GCP-Enrichment-Remediation/readme_images/GCP_-_Firewall_Remediation.png)\n\n### Automation Scripts\n\n#### GCPProjectHierarchy\n\nAutomation to determine GCP project hierarchy by looking up parent objects until the organization level is reached.\n\n![GCPProjectHierarchy](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-dist/content/packs/GCP-Enrichment-Remediation/readme_images/GCPProjecHierarchy.png)\n\n#### GCPOffendingFirewallRule\n\nAutomation to determine potential offending firewall rules in GCP based on port, protocol and possibly target tags (network tags).\n\n![GCPOffendingFirewallRule](https://storage.googleapis.com/marketplace-dist/content/packs/GCP-Enrichment-Remediation/readme_images/GCP_-_Enrichment.png)",
