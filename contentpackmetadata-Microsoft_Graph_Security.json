This helps prevent content from being immediately deleted and provides admins the opportunity to search for and restore content before it may be permanently deleted after the delay hold period expires. For more information, see Removing content locations from an eDiscovery hold.\nClosing a case only turns off the holds that are associated with that case. If other holds are placed on a content location (such as a Litigation Hold, a retention policy, or a hold from a different eDiscovery (Standard) case) those holds will still be maintained.\nThe case is still listed on the eDiscovery (Standard) page in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. The details, holds, searches, and members of a closed case are retained.\nYou can edit a case after it's closed. For example, you can add or remove members, create searches, and export search results.
