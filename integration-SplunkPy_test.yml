  Splunk Enterprise Security Users\n\n## Fetching notable events\nThe integration
  allows for fetching Splunk notable events using a default query. The query can be
  changed and modified to support different Splunk use cases. (See [Existing users](#existing-users)).\nPalo
  Alto highly recommends reading the [Ingest Incidents from a SIEM Using Splunk article](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar/6-2/cortex-xsoar-tutorials/tutorials/splunk-use-case.html)
  before starting to use this integration.\nThis article will help you configure your
  Splunk integration, set up a basic flow, and start ingesting incidents from Splunk
  to Cortex XSOAR.\n\n### How to configure\n1. Select __Settings__>__Integrations__>__Servers
  & Services__>__SplunkPy PreRelease__.\n2. Click **Add Instance**.\n3. Select **Fetches
  incidents**.\n4. Under Classifier, select N/A.\n5. Under Incident Type, select **Splunk
  Notable Generic**.\nYou do not need to specify the classifier as all Splunk incidents
  are ingested as Splunk Notable Generic. As you become more familiar with Cortex
  XSOAR, you can create custom incident types as needed instead of using the Splunk
  Notable Generic incident type.\n7. Under Mapper (incoming), select **Splunk - Notable
  Generic Incoming Mapper**.\n8. Under Mapper (outgoing), select **Splunk - Notable
  Generic Outgoing Mapper**.\n\n9. Type the Host -ip, username, password, and Port.\n10.
  Keep the Get notable events EQ query as is, as we use the Notable macro when ingesting
  events. You can create a more granular search by specifying specific conditions
  such as specific security domain, event ID, etc.\n11. Keep the defaults for fetch
  limit, first fetch timestamp, earliest time to fetch, and latest time to fetch.\n12.
  To add mirroring in both environments, in the Incident Mirroring Direction field,
  select **Incoming and Outgoing**.\nOutgoing mirroring is recommended for Cortex
  XSOAR version 6.2 and above. If you enable mirroring, you need to add the timezone
  of the Splunk server (in minutes). For example, if using GMT and the timezone is
  GMT +3 hours, set the timezone to +180. For UTC, set the timezone to 0. Set this
  only if the Splunk server is different than the Cortex XSOAR server. This is relevant
  only for fetching notable events.\n13. Select *Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident* and
  *Close Mirrored Splunk Notable Event*, so when closing in one environment, it closes
  in the other.\n14. In the Enrichment Types field, select *Asset*, *Drilldown* and
  *Identity*.\nThis enrichment provides additional information about assets, drilldown,
  and identities that are related to the notable events you ingest. For more information,
  see [Enriching Notable Events](#enriching-notable-events).\n15. Fetch backwards
  window - this backward window is for cases where there is a gap between the event
  occurrence time and the event index time on the server.\nIn Splunk, there is often
  a delay between the time an incident is created (the event's \"occurrence time\")
  and the time it is actually searchable in Splunk and visible in the index (the event's
  \"index time\").\nThis delay can be caused by an inefficient Splunk architecture,
  causing higher event indexing latency. However, it can also be \"by design\", e.g.,
  if some endpoints / machines that generate Splunk events are usually offline.\nAnother
  point to note is that Splunk's searches are based on the occurrence time behind
  the scenes. Meaning, Splunk itself uses occurrence time as its determining factor
  for bucket division and search.\nTherefore, we can't use index time as our primary
  search key without making the searches inefficient.\nThe backwards window is a way
  for you to configure the longest delay you would like to support.\nThis parameter
  determines the size of the occurrence time \"sliding window\" we will support in
  our queries. For example, if set for 2 hours, we will always search for events that
  occurred up to 2 hours ago (and will of course ignore duplicates).\nHowever, there
  is obviously a price - the larger the window, the longer it will take for fetch
  queries to complete.\nThe best value to set depends on the delays that you see in
  your system (consult with your Splunk expert / master), the number of events in
  your system, and other network properties.\nUse this parameter with careful consideration.\n16.
  Click **Test** and then **Save & exit**.\n\n**Note: If you are using a custom incident
  type, you also need to create custom corresponding incoming and outgoing mappers.**
  \n\n**Important: If you want to use the mirror mechanism, the incoming mapper must
  contain the following fields: dbotMirrorDirection, dbotMirrorId, dbotMirrorInstance**\n\n###
  Enriching Notable Events\nThis integration allows 3 types of enrichments for fetched
  notables: Drilldown, Asset, and Identity.\n\n#### Enrichment types\n1. **Drilldown
  search enrichment**: Fetches the drilldown search configured by the user in the
  rule name that triggered the notable event and performs this search. The results
  are stored in the context of the incident under the **Drilldown** field.\n2. **Asset
  search enrichment**: Runs the following query:\n*| inputlookup append=T asset_lookup_by_str
  where asset=$ASSETS_VALUE | inputlookup append=t asset_lookup_by_cidr where asset=$ASSETS_VALUE
  | rename _key as asset_id | stats values(*) as * by asset_id*\nwhere the **$ASSETS_VALUE**
  is replaced with the **src**, **dest**, **src_ip** and **dst_ip** from the fetched
  notable. The results are stored in the context of the incident under the **Asset**
  field.\n3. **Identity search enrichment**: Runs the following query\n*`| inputlookup
  identity_lookup_expanded where identity=$IDENTITY_VALUE*\nwhere the **$IDENTITY_VALUE**
  is replaced with the **user** and **src_user** from the fetched notable event. The
  results are stored in the context of the incident under the **Identity** field.\n\n####
  How to configure\n1. Configure the integration to fetch incidents (see the Integration
  documentation for details).\n2. *Enrichment Types*: Select the enrichment types
  you want to enrich each fetched notable with. If none are selected, the integration
  will fetch notables as usual (without enrichment).\n3. *Fetch notable events ES
  query*: The query for the notable events enrichment (defined by default). If you
  decide to edit this, make sure to provide a query that uses the \\`notable\\` macro.
  See the default query as an example.  \n4. *Enrichment Timeout (Minutes)*:  The
  timeout for each enrichment (default is 5min). When the selected timeout was reached,
  notable events that were not enriched will be saved without the enrichment.\n5.
  *Number of Events Per Enrichment Type*: The maximal amount of events to fetch per
  enrichment type (default to 20).\n\n#### Troubleshooting enrichment status\nEach
  enriched incident contains the following fields in the incident context:\n- **successful_drilldown_enrichment**:
  whether the drilldown enrichment was successful.\n- **successful_asset_enrichment**:
  whether the asset enrichment was successful.\n- **successful_identity_enrichment**:
  whether the identity enrichment was successful.\n\n#### Resetting the enriching
  fetch mechanism\nRun the ***splunk-reset-enriching-fetch-mechanism*** command and
  the mechanism will be reset to the initial configuration. (No need to use the **Last
  Run** button).\n\n#### Limitations\n- As the enrichment process is asynchronous,
  fetching enriched incidents takes longer. The integration was tested with 20+ notables
  simultaneously that were fetched and enriched after approximately ~4min.\n- If you
  wish to configure a mapper, wait for the integration to perform the first fetch
  successfully. This is to make the fetch mechanism logic stable.\n- The drilldown
  search does not support Splunk's advanced syntax. For example: Splunk filters (**|s**,
  **|h**, etc.)  \n\n### Incident Mirroring\n**Important Notes** \n - This feature
  is available from Cortex XSOAR version 6.0.0.\n - This feature is supported by Splunk
  Enterprise Security only.\n - In order for the mirroring to work, the *Incident
  Mirroring Direction* parameter needs to be set before the incident is fetched.\n
  - In order to ensure the mirroring works as expected, mappers are required, both
  for incoming and outgoing, to map the expected fields in Cortex XSOAR and Splunk.
  \n - For mirroring the *owner* field, the usernames need to be transformed to the
  corresponding names in Cortex XSOAR and Splunk.\n \nYou can enable incident mirroring
  between Cortex XSOAR incidents and Splunk notables.\nTo set up mirroring:\n1. Navigate
  to __Settings__ > __Integrations__ > __Servers & Services__.\n2. Search for SplunkPy
  and select your integration instance.\n3. Enable **Fetches incidents**.\n4. You
  can go to the *Fetch notable events ES enrichment query* parameter and select the
  query to fetch the notables from Splunk. Make sure to provide a query which uses
  the \\`notable\\` macro, See the default query as an example.\n4. In the *Incident
  Mirroring Direction* integration parameter, select in which direction the incidents
  should be mirrored:\n    - Incoming - Any changes in Splunk notables (notable's
  status, status_label, urgency, comments, and owner) will be reflected in Cortex
  XSOAR incidents.\n    - Outgoing - Any changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents (notable's
  status (not status_label), urgency, comments, and owner) will be reflected in Splunk
  notables.\n    - Incoming And Outgoing - Changes in Cortex XSOAR incidents and Splunk
  notables will be reflected in both directions.\n    - None - Turns off incident
  mirroring.\n5. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored XSOAR Incident* integration parameter
  to close the Cortex XSOAR incident when the corresponding notable is closed on the
  Splunk side.\n6. Optional: Check the *Close Mirrored Splunk Notable Event* integration
  parameter to close the Splunk notable when the corresponding Cortex XSOAR incident
  is closed.\n7. Fill in the **timezone** integration parameter with the timezone
  the Splunk server is using.\nNewly fetched incidents will be mirrored in the chosen
  direction.\n**Note: This will not effect existing incidents.**\n\n### Existing users\n**NOTE:
  The enrichment and mirroring mechanisms use a new default fetch query.** \nThis
  implies that new fetched events might have a slightly different structure than old
  events fetched so far.\nUsers who wish to enrich or mirror fetched notables and
  have already used the integration in the past:\n- Might have to slightly change
  the existing logic for some of their custom entities configured for Splunk (Playbooks,
  Mappers, Pre-Processing Rules, Scripts, Classifiers, etc.) in order for them to
  work with the modified structure of the fetched events. \n- Will need to change
  the *Fetch notable events ES enrichment query* integration parameter to the following
  query (or a fetch query of their own that uses the \\`notable\\` macro): \n\n```\nsearch
  `notable` | eval rule_name=if(isnull(rule_name),source,rule_name) | eval rule_title=if(isnull(rule_title),rule_name,rule_title)
  | `get_urgency` | `risk_correlation` | eval rule_description=if(isnull(rule_description),source,rule_description)
  | eval security_domain=if(isnull(security_domain),source,security_domain)\n```\n\n#
  Splunk non-Enterprise Security Users\n\n### Configure Splunk to Produce Alerts for
  SplunkPy for non-ES Splunk Users\n\nPalo Alto recommends that you configure Splunk
  to produce basic alerts that the SplunkPy integration can ingest, by creating a
  summary index in which alerts are stored. The SplunkPy integration can then query
  that index for incident ingestion. It is not recommended to use the Cortex XSOAR
  application with Splunk for routine event consumption because this method is not
  able to be monitored and is not scalable.\n\n1. Create a summary index in Splunk.
  For more information, click [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/Indexer/Setupmultipleindexes#Create_events_indexes_2).\n2.
  Build a query to return relevant alerts.\n![image](./../../doc_files/build-query.png)\n3.
  Identify the fields list from the Splunk query and save it to a local file.\n![image](./../../doc_files/identify-fields-list.png)\n4.
  Define a search macro to capture the fields list that you saved locally. For more
  information, click [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/Knowledge/Definesearchmacros).\nUse
  the following naming convention: (demisto_fields_{type}).\n![image](./../../doc_files/micro-name.png)\n![image](./../../doc_files/macro.png)\n5.
  Define a scheduled search, the results of which are stored in the summary index.
  For more information about scheduling searches, click [here](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/7.3.0/Knowledge/Definesearchmacros).
  \n![image](./../../doc_files/scheduled-search.png)\n6. In the Summary indexing section,
  select the summary index, and enter the {key:value} pair for Cortex XSOAR classification.\n![image](./../../doc_files/summary-index.png)\n7.
  Configure the incident type in Cortex XSOAR by navigating to __Settings > Advanced
  > Incident Types.__ Note: In the example, Splunk Generic is a custom incident type.\n![image](./../../doc_files/incident_type.png)\n8.
  Configure the classification. Make sure that your non ES incident fields are associated
  with your custom incident type.\n   1. Navigate to __Settings > Integrations > Classification
  & Mapping__.\n   1. Click your classifier.\n   2. Select your instance.\n   3. Click
  the fetched data.\n   4. Drag the value to the appropriate incident type.\n![image](./../../doc_files/classify.png)\n9.
  Configure the mapping. Make sure to map your non ES fields accordingly and make
  sure that these incident fields are associated with their custom incident type.\n
  \  1. Navigate to __Settings > Integrations > Classification & Mapping__.\n   1.
  Click your mapper.\n   2. Select your instance.\n   3. Click the __Choose data path__
  link for the field you want to map.\n   4. Click the data from the Splunk fields
  to map it to Cortex XSOAR.\n![image](./../../doc_files/mapping.png)\n10. (Optional)
  Create custom fields.\n11. Build a playbook and assign it as the default for this
  incident type.\n\n### Constraints\nThe following features are not supported in non-ES
  (Enterprise Security) Splunk.\n- Incident Mirroring\n- Enrichment.\n- Content in
  the Splunk content pack (such as mappers, layout, playbooks, incident fields, and
  the incident type). Therefore, you will need to create your own content. See the
  [Cortex XSOAR Administrator’s Guide](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar.html)
