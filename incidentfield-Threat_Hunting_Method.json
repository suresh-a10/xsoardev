	"description": "1.  Intel-based threat hunting is a method that uses known indicators of compromise (IOCs) to identify threats. IOCs are pieces of data that can be used to identify a threat, such as IP addresses, domain names, hash values, or malware signatures. 2. Hypotheses-based threat hunting is a proactive threat hunting method that involves developing and testing hypotheses about potential threats. 3. Indicators of Attack (IOA)-based hunt is a threat hunting method that focuses on identifying and investigating indicators of attack (IOAs). IOAs are pieces of data that suggest that an attack is in progress or has recently occurred. They can include things like unusual network traffic patterns, suspicious file activity, or changes in user behavior. 4. hybrid hunt is a threat hunting method that combines elements of both intel-based and hypotheses-based hunting.",
